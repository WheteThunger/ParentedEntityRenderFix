This plugin fixes a bug where some parented entities, especially electrical entities like switches and search lights, tend to not render visually unless the player is near the center of the map, even though the player will still see interaction prompts if they look in the right place.

Here are some example plugins that parent electrical entities that have this problem. Installing this plugin should mostly address the issue for their use cases.

- Car Turrets (switches)
- MiniCopter Options (switches, search lights)
- WarCopter (switches, search lights)
- Bomb Trucks (RF receivers)
- Turrets Extended (switches)

Note: This plugin does not completely solve the problem for entities that move. However, players will be able to see them again by disconnecting or leaving the area and returning.
